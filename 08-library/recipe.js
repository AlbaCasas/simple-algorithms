/**
 * Create a library app to manage your books. This app will ask the user to choose from a list of options upon starting:
 * - Add a book (add)
 * - View collection (view)
 * - Exit (exit)
 * 
 * If the user inputs "add" your app should ask him to write different properties of the book he is adding, 
 * these properties will be "title", "author" and "numberOfPages". Once the user enters all three, the book will be added to his collection.
 * 
 * If the user inputs "view", your app should show him a list of the TITLES of his books.
 * 
 * If the user inputs "exit", your app should tell him "Bye!" and exit.
 *
